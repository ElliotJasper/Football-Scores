Beta statup for node and react application for a last man standing football game. Uses external API to fetch football fixtures and stores, then the front end calls my own API to prevent harassing the external one. Stripe integration where users pay for an API key to be able to use the API I created in Node JS. Other apps will build of this API to create the games.
